## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As an Indian college student, I want to discover and evaluate professors at my university and others across India through peer reviews, so I can make informed decisions about course selection and understand teaching quality before enrollment. The platform should feel natural for Indian academic culture while maintaining review credibility through moderation.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a student visits the platform, **When** they search for a professor by name or college, **Then** they see relevant professor profiles with aggregate ratings
2. **Given** a student finds a professor, **When** they view the professor's profile, **Then** they see categorized ratings (clarity, helpfulness, workload, engagement) and text reviews
3. **Given** a student wants to share their experience, **When** they submit a review, **Then** they can rate in multiple categories, write comments, and choose to remain anonymous
4. **Given** a student encounters inappropriate content, **When** they flag a review, **Then** the review enters moderation queue for admin review
5. **Given** a moderator needs to review flagged content, **When** they access the moderation dashboard, **Then** they can approve, remove, or warn based on community guidelines

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a professor has no reviews yet? Display appropriate messaging encouraging first review
- How does system handle duplicate professor entries? Prevent duplicates through college-department-name matching
- What if a review contains regional language text? Support UTF-8 storage for Hindi and regional languages
- How does system prevent spam or fake reviews? Implement rate limiting and pattern detection for moderation queue
- What happens when a student tries to review the same professor multiple times? Allow one review per student per professor with edit capability
