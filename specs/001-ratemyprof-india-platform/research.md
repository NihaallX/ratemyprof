# Phase 0: Research & Technical Decisions

**Date**: September 10, 2025  
**Feature**: RateMyProf India Platform  
**Status**: Complete

## Research Tasks Completed

### 1. Full-Text Search Implementation for Professor Discovery

**Decision**: PostgreSQL with GIN indexes using tsvector/tsquery  
**Rationale**: 
- Native PostgreSQL full-text search provides sufficient performance for MVP
- GIN indexes enable fast text searching across professor names, colleges, departments
- Supports ranking and relevance scoring out of the box
- No additional infrastructure complexity compared to external search engines
- Can be upgraded to pgvector for semantic search in future iterations

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Elasticsearch: Overkill for MVP scale, additional infrastructure complexity
- Simple LIKE queries: Poor performance, no ranking capabilities
- External search APIs: Cost and dependency concerns for Indian market

### 2. Anonymous Review System with Accountability

**Decision**: Optional anonymity with tracked user associations  
**Rationale**:
- Store user_id (nullable) and anon_display_name for all reviews
- Anonymous reviews still tied to accounts for moderation purposes
- Enables pattern detection for spam/abuse while preserving user privacy
- Allows users to edit their own anonymous reviews via session tracking
- Supports appeals process with user identification when needed

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Fully anonymous (no user tracking): Impossible to prevent spam/abuse
- No anonymity: Would reduce honest feedback due to cultural concerns
- Token-based anonymity: Added complexity without significant benefits

### 3. Moderation System for Indian Cultural Context

**Decision**: Hybrid automated + human moderation  
**Rationale**:
- Automated: Profanity filter, spam detection, excessive flagging patterns
- Human review: Cultural sensitivity, context understanding, appeals
- Community flagging: Users can flag inappropriate content for review
- Escalation: Flagged content automatically queued for human moderator review
- Appeals process: Users can contest moderation decisions

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Fully automated: Cannot handle cultural nuances and context
- Fully manual: Not scalable, too slow for user experience
- Pre-moderation: Would significantly slow down user experience

### 4. Authentication Strategy for Indian Students

**Decision**: Email/password + Google OAuth with email verification  
**Rationale**:
- Email verification prevents spam accounts while allowing broader access
- Google OAuth provides convenience for users with existing accounts
- No college email requirement for MVP to maximize accessibility
- Future: Add college email verification for "verified reviewer" badges
- Supports both personal and institutional email addresses

**Alternatives Considered**:
- College email only: Too restrictive, many students use personal emails
- Phone number verification: Privacy concerns, additional SMS costs
- Social media login: Less professional context for academic reviews

### 5. Multi-Category Rating System Design

**Decision**: 4-category rating (clarity, helpfulness, workload, engagement) with 5-point scale  
**Rationale**:
- Clarity: How well professor explains concepts (core academic concern)
- Helpfulness: Availability and support outside class (student success focus)  
- Workload: Assignment and exam difficulty (workload management)
- Engagement: Teaching style and student interaction (learning experience)
- 5-point scale: Familiar pattern, sufficient granularity without choice paralysis

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Single overall rating: Too simplistic, doesn't help course selection
- 10+ categories: Choice paralysis, harder to compare professors
- 1-10 scale: Too granular, inconsistent user interpretations

### 6. Database Schema for Indian Academic Structure

**Decision**: Hierarchical college-department-professor structure with location metadata  
**Rationale**:
- Colleges table with state/city for geographic filtering
- Department normalization to handle naming variations
- Professor table with known_as field for nickname support
- Supports both "Professor" and "Faculty" terminology
- State-wise organization matches Indian education system structure

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Flat structure: Poor scalability, difficult geographic filtering
- University-college hierarchy: Too complex for MVP, many institutions have different structures
- Course-based organization: Not suitable for professor-centric reviews

### 7. Mobile-First Design Requirements

**Decision**: Responsive web application with Progressive Web App (PWA) features  
**Rationale**:
- 80%+ Indian students access internet primarily via mobile devices
- PWA provides app-like experience without app store complexity
- Single codebase for all devices reduces development/maintenance overhead
- Offline capability for viewing cached professor profiles and reviews
- Touch-optimized interface with proper spacing and controls

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Desktop-first: Misaligned with user behavior in Indian market
- Native mobile apps: Higher development complexity, app store barriers
- Mobile-only: Excludes desktop users who may have better typing experience for reviews

## Technology Stack Validation

### Backend Framework: FastAPI
- **Strengths**: Fast development, automatic API documentation, excellent type hints
- **Validation**: Handles concurrent users well, good ecosystem for Python data tools
- **Fit**: Ideal for rapid MVP development with clear API contracts

### Frontend Framework: Next.js/React  
- **Strengths**: Server-side rendering for SEO, excellent mobile performance
- **Validation**: Large ecosystem, good PWA support, TypeScript integration
- **Fit**: Perfect for content-heavy application with search requirements

### Database: PostgreSQL
- **Strengths**: ACID compliance, full-text search, JSON support, strong ecosystem
- **Validation**: Handles complex queries well, good scalability for projected load
- **Fit**: Excellent for structured data with search requirements

## Performance Targets Validation

- **API Response Time**: <200ms achievable with proper indexing and query optimization
- **Concurrent Users**: 1000+ supported with standard PostgreSQL configuration and connection pooling
- **Page Load Time**: <2s achievable with SSR, image optimization, and CDN usage
- **Database Scale**: 50k professors, 500k reviews easily handled by PostgreSQL

## Security & Compliance Considerations

- **Data Protection**: Hash passwords, encrypt PII, secure API endpoints
- **Indian IT Law Compliance**: Data residency in Indian servers, user consent mechanisms
- **Content Moderation**: Automated scanning + human review to prevent legal issues
- **User Privacy**: Anonymous review option, secure data handling practices

## Next Steps

All technical decisions are documented and validated. No NEEDS CLARIFICATION items remaining.
Ready to proceed to Phase 1: Design & Contracts.
